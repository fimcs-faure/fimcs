        <li>
          In the 1990s, people used to <span class="bold">take photos</span> or to <span class="bold">make videos to keep memories</span> of important events or persons. In 2010, people <span class="bold">take selfies or ussies</span> that they <span class="bold">share via a social network</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the 18th Century, rich Britishs families had their portraits painted. They wanted <span class="bold">to share common activities</span>, such as hunts, meals, or parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2011, in the US, the Obama family <span class="bold">shared a tweet</span> on Twitter. The photograph <span class="bold">showed</span> a happy, united family. They were all smiling. In fact, they were celebrating Christmas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Photos mean much more than a captured image, they are an expression of <span class="bold">who we are</span> and how we feel. They <span class="bold">define us</span> as a human being with specific character traits.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2014, in San Salvador, a teacher and his pupils decided to take an ussie in their class. They wanted to show that they were <span class="bold">having fun, working together</span>. They wanted to share a good moment.
        </li>
        <li>
          A selfie is more than a photograph. It is <span class="bold">explaining a moment</span> or <span class="bold">telling a story</span>.

      <h2>Digital memories :</h2>
      <p>What is our relation with photography? I think that what has happened is that we have in some senses offset our memory into these devices.</p>
      <p>There was an alert on the television in the UK recently, and it said 'today I saved the life of my daughters' and the actual product on sale was a digital camera. What the advert was saying was that you need to capture umages, you need to capture those images of those moments in your life otherwise you won't have your live.</p>
      <p>Do you see what I mean? Your life is becoming those digital artefacts and if you don't create them, dit that moment really happened? Is that moment really authentic? Are we getting to the point whereby unless we capture something it never happened? Unless we share it, unless we get that response back from social media, it wasn't authentic, it didn't happen.</p>
      <p>What is important is the moment of capture, that we've closen to capture, that event as a digital artefact, as an image. Is it important that we go back and look it again? That's questionable.</p>
      <p>But, it's certainly shifted from when we'd take those photographs of the family picnic or of the wedding, of these rites of passage, of these particular moments, the first day of school, these were real milestones in people's lives that we were using to hold on to this timeline of memories.</p>
      <p>I think now it's too much more of a flow but it's very much to do with the idea that an event needs to be captured, even if it doesn't need to be reviewed, to be seen or to be thought of as authentic.</p>

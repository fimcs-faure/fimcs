      <h2>Hell's Kitchen :</h2>
      <p>This document is a program, a reality TV show, or series. The extract we have been watching is the best moments of season 15. It takes place in the 2020s in the US. Food teams and contestants are competing to score points to win the food or cooking contest. They have to use ingredients to make recipes; they have to cook dishes that will look good taste great to score points to win the final. If they meet these cooking challenges, they will win the grand prize. The chef is a British famous cook called Gordon Ramsey who will not only give them orders but also tips to perform their tasks. In order to put pressure on the teams, he usually invites a guest that features in the show and helps him make the final decision.</p>

      <p>The document is an interview for the American TV show “Good Morning America” that was broadcast in 2018. A new study warns parents not to talk about dieting to their kids. In fact, they put a lot of pressure on the teen’s shoulders who are already under a lot of pressure from their peers and the social medias. It is a time in their life when they are not comfortable with the changes in their bodies. So, if their child needs dieting or losing weight; it could be a good idea to seek help from a professional. Because parents are regarded as models, it is important for them to walk the walk.</p>
